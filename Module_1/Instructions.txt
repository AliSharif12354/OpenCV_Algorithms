How to use the edge detection and sticks filter algorithms:

First, install OpenCV library for Python on your system.

Change the <image = cv.imread("")> lines of code to the path of the image you would like to use edge detection/sticks filter on.

This line of code is found on line 172 on EdgeDetection.py and line 95 on SticksFilter.py
